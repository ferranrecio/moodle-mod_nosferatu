    @template mod_nosferatu/beginner

    This template include all the reactive aplication.

    In this example the state is loaded almost inmidiate because it is a fully frontend
    aplication. However, in future examples it will act as an async loader.

    Example context (json):
    {
    }
}}
<p>This example follows the same logic as the "Get started" example but the file structure
follows the real conventions.</p>
<p>In next examples you will see how to add backend webservices to the equation. For now,
the feature is still a full frontend aplications without any interaction with the backend.</p>
<div id="mod-nosferatu-main">
    {{! the city component will be loaded when the state is ready }}
    <div data-for="city-people"> Loading city people...</div>
