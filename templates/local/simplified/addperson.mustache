    @template mod_nosferatu/local/simplified/addperson

    Reactive component to add a new persone to the city.

    This component is an example of a reactive component that uses mostly static content.
    The component is only refreshed when a new person is creatred or deleted. When happens,
    the only thing to recalculate if the max limit of people in the city is reached.

    As you see in this example, data-mdl-refresh="static" is used to indicate that the component
    do not need to diff the inner content, but it is still able to add or remove the static elements
    form the parent container. This happens because the sorting, deletion and creation of elements
    is done by the parent component, while the static validation is done when the specific node is
    diffed.

    Using the same pattern, we can generate big and complex components that are still reactive and
    efficient.

    Example context (json):
    {
        "limitreached": false
    }
}}
<div
    class="border rounded p-3 mb-2"
    data-mdl-nosferatu-region="addperson"
>
    {{#limitreached}}
    <p
        data-mdl-refresh="static"
    >
        You have reached the limit of people in the city.
    </p>
    {{/limitreached}}
    {{^limitreached}}
    <form
        class="form-inline"
        data-mdl-refresh="static"
    >
        <input
            class="form-control"
            type="text"
            name="name"
            placeholder="Name"
            data-mdl-ref="name"
        >
        <input
            class="btn btn-primary ml-2"
            type="submit"
            value="Add new person"
            data-mdl-ref="button"
        >
    </form>
    {{/limitreached}}
</div>
